# Python-Miniproject 1
The objective of this miniproject is to exercise your ability to wrangle tabular data set and aggregate large data sets into meaningful summary statistics. We will be working with the same medical data used in the pw miniproject, but will be leveraging the power of Pandas to more efficiently represent and act on our data.
